## Introduction

This package aims at the *construction of Moire Superlattices, acquisition of their effective models, and investigation of their low-energy physics*, based on the [QuantumLattices](https://github.com/Quantum-Many-Body/QuantumLattices.jl) pack and the [TightBindingApproximation](https://github.com/Quantum-Many-Body/TightBindingApproximation.jl) pack.

## Installation

In Julia **v1.10+**, please type `]` in the REPL to use the package mode, then type this command:

```julia
pkg> add MoireSuperlattices
```

## Getting Started

[Examples of Moire Superlattice](@ref examples)

## Note

Due to the fast development of this package, releases with different minor version numbers are **not** guaranteed to be compatible with previous ones **before** the release of v1.0.0. Comments are welcomed in the issues.
